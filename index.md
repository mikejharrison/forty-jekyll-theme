I'm a creative English language teaching professional based in the UK. I wear many hats in the world of ELT – teacher, trainer, materials writer, volunteer – the diversity of work that can be done in the sector keeps me going. I'm at my best when trying to come up with creative and imaginative solutions, whether that's in the classroom with my students or in front of the computer designing resources.

My broad range of experience includes developing digital materials for language learners, delivering training in making the most of technology, and producing quality video and audio. Find out what I can bring to your projects...
